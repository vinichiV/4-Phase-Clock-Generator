# 4-Phase Clock Generator
Generating four distinct clock phases, each phase being equally spaced in time (90Â°).<br>
By using two D-type flip-flops (four phases, two bits), we can design a four-phase clock generator circuit (synchronous):
- Input: Initialization pulse.
- Output: 4 clock pulses with 4 distinct phases (p1, p2, p3, p4), each having equal phase shift.<br>
